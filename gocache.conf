# GoCache Configuration File
# Example configuration with default values

################################## NETWORK ####################################

# By default, if no "bind" configuration directive is specified, GoCache listens
# for connections from all the network interfaces available on the server.
# It is possible to listen to just one or multiple selected interfaces using
# the "bind" configuration directive, followed by one or more IP addresses.
bind 127.0.0.1

# Accept connections on the specified port, default is 6379.
port 16379

################################## GENERAL #####################################

# The number of databases. The default database is DB 0.
databases 16

# Set the maximum number of connected clients at the same time. By default
# this limit is set to 10000 clients.
maxclients 10000

# Close the connection after a client is idle for N seconds (0 to disable)
timeout 0

################################## SNAPSHOTTING  ################################

# Save the DB on disk:
#
#   save <seconds> <changes>
#
#   Will save the DB if both the given number of seconds and the given
#   number of write operations against the DB occurred.
#
#   In the example below the behaviour will be to save:
#   After 900 sec (15 min) if at least 1 key changed
#   After 300 sec (5 min) if at least 10 keys changed
#   After 60 sec if at least 10000 keys changed
#
# Note: you can disable saving at all commenting all the "save" lines.

# save 900 1
# save 300 10
# save 60 10000

# The filename where to dump the DB
dbfilename dump.rdb

################################## APPEND ONLY MODE ###############################

# By default appendonly is no, enabling it will use AOF for persistence
appendonly yes

# The name of the append only file (default: "appendonly.aof")
appendfilename appendonly.aof

# The fsync() call tells the Operating System to actually write data on disk
# instead of waiting for more data in the output buffer. Some OS will really flush
# data on disk, some other OS will just try to do it ASAP.
#
# Redis supports three different modes:
#
# no: don't fsync, just let the OS flush the data when it wants. Faster.
# always: fsync after every write to the append only log. Slow, Safest.
# everysec: fsync only one time every second. Compromise.
#
# The default is "everysec", as that's usually the right compromise between
# speed and data safety. It's up to you to understand if you can relax this to
# "no" that will let the operating system flush the output buffer when
# it wants, for better performances (but if you can live with the idea of
# some data loss consider the default persistence mode that's snapshotting),
# or on the contrary, use "always" that's very slow but a bit safer than
# everysec.
#
# More details please check the following article:
# http://antirez.com/post/redis-persistence-demystified.html
#
# If unsure, use "everysec".

################################## SECURITY ####################################

# Require clients to issue AUTH <PASSWORD> before processing any other
# commands.  This might be useful in environments in which you do not trust
# others with access to the host running goCache.
#
# This should stay commented out for backward compatibility and because most
# people do not need auth (e.g. they run their own servers).
#
# Warning: since GoCache is pretty fast an outside user can try up to
# 150k passwords per second against a good box. This means that you should
# use a very strong password otherwise it will be very easy to break.
#
requirepass yourpassword

################################## LOGGING #####################################

# Set the server log level.
# This can be one of:
# debug (a lot of information, useful for development/testing)
# verbose (many rarely useful info, but not a mess like the debug level)
# notice (moderately verbose, what you want in production probably)
# warning (only very important / critical messages are logged)
loglevel info

# Specify the log file name. Also the empty string can be used to force
# GoCache to log on the standard output.
# If not specified, log to stdout.
logfile ""
